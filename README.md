# LocalMH
LocalMH is an infrastructure for local (in a working tree) management of the content in http://MathHub.info.

The infrastructure consists of set of resources (Makefiles, LaTeX Packages, LaTeXML, sTeX) and a management tool lmh.

## Installation

There are several ways to install lmh. The easiest way is:

```bash
pip install lmh
lmh core --install
```

Note that the pip baased installation might require python development tools to be installed
(package python-dev on Ubuntu / Debian).

This will clone lmh from http://gl.mathhub.info/MathHub/localmh. To manually install lmh, simply installed the dependencies and then clone lmh to a directory of your choice. Then add the subdirectory bin to your $PATH.

Once lmh is installed, you will have to run

```bash
lmh setup --install
```

for lmh to install and configure run-time dependencies correctly.

### Upgrade

To upgrade onyl lmh itself run:

```bash
lmh selfupdate
```

Note that this will not automatically update dependencies. To update dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade lmh
```

### Dependencies

Currently only *nix-based systems are supported.

sudo apt-get install python python-pip python-dev subversion git texlive cpanminus libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libgdbm-dev
```
