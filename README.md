# LocalMH
LocalMH is an infrastructure for local (in a working tree) management of the content in http://MathHub.info. 

The infrastructure consists of set of resources (Makefiles, LaTeX Packages, LaTeXML, sTeX) and a management tool lmh. 

## Installation

There are several ways to install lmh. The easiest way is: 

```bash
pip install lmh
lmh core --install
```

This will clone lmh from http://gl.mathhub.info/MathHub/localmh. To manually install lmh, simply installed the dependencies and then clone lmh to a directory of your choice. Then add the subdirectory bin to your $PATH. 

Once lmh is installed, you will have to run

```bash
lmh setup
```
